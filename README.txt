This directory contains the code for the 'ChitwanABM' an agent-based model of 
the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal. The model represents a subset of the 
population of the Valley using a number of agent types (person, household and 
neighborhood agents) and environmental variables (topography, land use and land 
cover) and social context variables.

The ChitwanABM model relies on restricted access data from the Chitwan 
Valley Family Study to generate the agents that populate the model. This 
restricted access data can be obtained by contacting the Inter-university 
Consortium for Political and Social Research (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/). 

The model was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation research 
at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of Geography. Contact 
Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.
