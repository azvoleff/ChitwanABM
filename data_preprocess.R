# This file is part of the ChitwanABM agent-based model.
#
# rcparams.default provides the default values that are used for the ChitwanABM 
# if no local ChitwanABMrc file is provided when the model is run, or that are 
# used if any parameters are missing from it.
# 
# Parameters are specifed in the following format:
#
# 	'parameter_name' : [default_value | validation_function] # Comment
#
# where 'parameter_name' is the name of the parameter, 'default_value' is the 
# default value, and validation_function one of the set of validation functions 
# listed in rcsetup.py. The validation function is used to ensure that only 
# valid values are provided to the model.
#
# Any comments or newline characters after the 'START OF RC DEFINITION' line 
# below will be included in any rc files built using the 'write_RC_file' 
# function  in rcsetup.py. The order in which the parameters  are specified in 
# this file will be retained when rc files are generated by the 'write_RC_file' 
# function.
