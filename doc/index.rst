ChitwanABM Documentation
=============================
'ChitwanABM' is an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal.  The 
model represents a subset of the population of the Valley using a number of 
agent types (person, household and neighborhood agents), environmental 
variables (topography, land use and land cover) and social context variables.

Construction of the model is supported as part of an ongoing `NSF
PIRE <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_ project investigating human-environment 
interactions in the Western Chitwan Valley.  Development of the model is in 
progress, and model documentation is still incomplete.  As work continues, this 
page will be updated with more information on initializing and running the 
model, and on interpreting the model output.

.. note:: The model requires restricted access survey data from the
    Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) to run. See the  `Interuniversity 
    Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) page on the CVFS 
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04538>`_ for more information.
